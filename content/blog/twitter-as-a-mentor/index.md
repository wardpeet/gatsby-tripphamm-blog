title: Twitter as a mentor

description: How I leveraged Twitter for tech-mentorship in the absence of a senior developer on my team
---

18 months ago I joined a new team at Vistaprint where I and 3 other developers were responsible for prototyping new features for Vistaprint's online editor, "Studio." We had all been working on outdated tech-stacks for a long time and were salivating at the thought of leaving JQuery and Backbone behind in favor of React and Redux. The problem was that none of us had a significant amount of experience with these newer frameworks and we were about to start creating a pretty complex application.

We brought up our concerns with our manager, and he was really understanding. It turned out that a lot of devs had been asking for mentorship in the front-end area, but Vistaprint wasn't having any luck finding the right candidates.

It didn't occur to me until much later that we were probably holding the bar too high. We were looking for developers with expert-level experience with technology that hadn't been around long enough for people to reach an expert level.

> "We were probably one of those companies requiring 5 years experience with a framework invented 3 years ago."

In any case, we were on our own for this project. Needless to say, mistakes were made. Without a guiding hand nudging us away from the common pitfalls, we experienced _all_ of them. It was painful at times, but _we learned a lot_ from those mistakes.

The project survived for about 10 months and--by the end of that period--we had some reasonably functional software. We had been showing it to a small portion of our customers along the way and it helped us collect some really useful feedback. Expectations were properly set with the business: "this is a prototype, and none of the code is expected to be production-ready," so this was a perfect learning experience for us. We got to practice building a real-world app with React and Redux without having to maintain the pile of tech debt that we inevitably created as newly-minted React developers.

After the team dissolved, we were told that the 4 of us were going to be spread across 4 different teams. Then it hit me like a bag of bricks: _we_ were supposed to be the front-end mentors for the rest of the company.

After the prototyping project, I had gained a bit of confidence in my front-end development skills, but in my mind I still wasn't ready to be anyone's tech mentor.

But I _really_ wanted to be successful in the role. I had developed a passion for front-end development and felt that this was an opportunity to take my career to the next level. **So, made a Twitter account**.

Given that Vistaprint wasn't going to be able to hire a time-traveling dev with 10 years of React experience, I decided to seek out the next best thing: the developers who were actually _building_ React and it's surrounding libraries. Luckily, they tweet **a lot**.

Folks like Dan Abramov and Ryan Florence are constantly engaging the community in discussions and sharing their thoughts on Twitter. There's no shortage of threads and links to blog posts. Notably, Dan's blog, [Overreacted.io](https://overreacted.io/), is an incredible resource for gaining a deep understanding of React.

To close this out, I'll list some of the folks/accounts that I've followed that have really helped me level-up my skills. If anyone has any recommendations for other JavaScript/Front-end thought-leaders to follow, please let me know--I can't get enough!

Also, I retweet everything that I find useful, so you can also [follow me](https://twitter.com/tripphamm) for highlights from these accounts.
