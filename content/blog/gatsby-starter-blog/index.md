description: Shallow-dive on all of the files generated by Gatsby + gatsby-starter-blog

## Who are you?

This is targeted toward folks who've bootstrapped a blog using [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) and want to gain a deeper understanding of what's going on underneath the hood.

If you haven't bootstrapped your gatsby-starter-blog yet, it's easy as pie:

```bash
npx gatsby new my-blog https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog
```

## Who am I?

Hi, my name is Tripp, and I'm a web developer at Vistaprint. I bootstrapped a blog with Gatsby and spent some time researching every file/dependency that was generated, so that you don't have to <3.

## Tangent

In some version of this post, I used the word, "eureka," and went on a tangent about it. "Eureka" didn't make the final cut, but I'm gonna leave the content in a footnote[^1] in case anyone is curious about word-origins like I am.

## Business time

Okay, so you looked up "gatsby blog" on Google, found `gatsby-starer-blog` on GitHub, ran a couple commands in your terminal and now you've got a pretty nice blog on your hands! You could just deploy this blog with [now.sh](https://zeit.co/now) and move on with your life, but then again, maybe that's not you.

Maybe you were the type of kid who took all of their toys apart and tried to put them back together (with varying degrees of success). Maybe you want to know _how_ it works.

Hopefully you do! Because that's what I'm writing about!

If that's not you, that's okay too. Let's be friends either way. Here's my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tripphamm) :)

### Let's read the manual

Gatsby gives us a nice README which has some brief descriptions of some of the top-level files. These explanations are pretty solid, so I'll include them as-is and supplement with bit more detail here and there.

    .
    ├── /.cache
    ├── /plugins
    ├── /public
    ├── src
      ├── /pages
      ├── /templates
      └── html.js
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js

**`/.cache`** _Automatically generated_. This folder is an internal cache created automatically by Gatsby. The files inside this folder are not meant for modification. Should be added to the .gitignore file if not added already.

**`/public`** _Automatically generated_. The output of the build process will be exposed inside this folder. Should be added to the .gitignore file if not added already.

**`/plugins`** This folder hosts any project-specific (“local”) plugins that aren’t published as an npm package. Check out the [plugin docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/plugins/) for more detail.

**`/src`** This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the frontend of your site (what you see in the browser), like your site header, or a page template. “Src” is a convention for “source code”.

**`/src/pages`** Components under src/pages become pages automatically with paths based on their file name. Check out the [pages docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/recipes/#creating-pages) for more detail.

**`/src/templates`** Contains templates for programmatically creating pages. Check out the [templates docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/#page-template-components) for more detail.

**`html.js`** For custom configuration of default .cache/default_html.js Check out the [custom html docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/custom-html/) for more detail.

**`/static`** If you put a file into the static folder, it will not be processed by Webpack. Instead it will be copied into the public folder untouched. Check out the [assets docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/static-folder/#adding-assets-outside-of-the-module-system) for more detail.

**`.prettierrc`** This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent. You can run the formatter whenever you'd like by executing `npm run format`, but I prefer to configure my editor to auto-format whenever I save. If you're using Visual Studio Code, try out the [Prettier Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

**`gatsby-browser.js`** This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser. Given that this file is bundled with your application, it is also a convenient spot to add imports like polyfills and global css files.

**`gatsby-config.js`** This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

**`gatsby-node.js`** This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

**`gatsby-ssr.js`** This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

[^1]: "Eureka" is a weird word, right? Before writing this, I had the vague idea that it's a thing that you can say when inspiration strikes and you finally figure out the answer to a tough problem, but I'd never really thought much about it. I get hung up on these things sometimes. Maybe you do too. [Here's the wikipedia article](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_(word)>). TL;DR - Ancient Greek scholar, Archimedes, famously exclaimed "Eureka! Eureka!" when he realized that he could measure the volume of an irregular solid by submerging it in water and measuring the amount of liquid that was displaced. The word itself comes from an ancient Greek term which roughly translates to: "I found it!"
